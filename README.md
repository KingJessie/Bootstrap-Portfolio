# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Overview

I rebuilt my portfolio using the Bootstrap framework to reduce the need for media queries and make the website more responsive. This allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, improving the user experience.

> **What is Bootstrap?**
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework that is used for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It contains a set of predefined CSS classes and JavaScript functions that make it easier to create a website quickly and consistently. Bootstrap provides a flexible grid system, pre-styled components, and plugins built on jQuery, all of which make it a popular choice for developing responsive websites.

## What I learned:

The design of my portfolio was taken to the next level through the customization of Bootstrap components. Not only did I have a great time working on this project, but I also learned how to use the framework and modify its default styles. I'm excited to continue improving my skills in web development so that I can create amazing web application with standout designs.
